        <p class="text-small">World is getting high on hunger !</p>

        <p class="text-small"> Approximately 690 million people go to bed with an empty stomach each night
          Talking about India only about 199 million people about 15% of India's total population is malnourished.
          Sad part is that about 3000 children die daily due to hunger and about 30% of new born babies dies from lack of nutrition.
          India is not a poor country yet hunger continues to be a major issue . </p>
          
          <p class="text-small">But the thing is that we are not low on food supplements , about one - third of food gets wasted everyday. This is what we are working on through this small initiative. We want to make use of this wasted food for eradicating as much as possible hunger we can. We will make use of this wasted food to provide it to  the people who really need it.</p>
